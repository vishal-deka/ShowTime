# ShowTime
An application built with ReactJS that works with TVMaze API to gather TV show data. <br>
Contains an overview of availble shows, one page that shows details of each show and a form to book tickets for the show. <br>
NOTE: The checkout feature in the form has not been implemented as of now so the checkout button will do nothing.<br>
